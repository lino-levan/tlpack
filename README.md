# TLPack

Welcome to my new personal project dubbed "thoughtlesspack".  

The mission of this project is to finally build a packing software that isn't so hard to configure. The philosophy mainly centers around the idea of useful error messages and good defaults. At the moment, speed or compression isn't a top priority, though the final file does get run though GCC.  

If you'd like to contribute, make a pull request and I'll go through changes when I have time.  

## Installation
